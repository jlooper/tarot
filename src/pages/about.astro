		<TextCard title="The AWS Tarot" text="The AWS Tarot is a not-too-serious Tarot card deck that matches Tarot card meanings with AWS services that align, more or less. Keep in mind that the various cards of the tarot have varied meanings according to the seeker. I like to think of this deck as a helper when trying to visualize some of the many services AWS has to offer. Maybe it will come in handy for you as you prepare for certification or are thinking about your infrastructure. It only includes the 22 cards of the Major Arcana, but if you'd like to think about the Tarot suits, you could visualize Cups as S3 buckets, and...I couldn't think of analogy for Wands, Swords, or Pentacles but let your imagination run wild!"/>
